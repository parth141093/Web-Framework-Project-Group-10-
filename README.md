# Web-Framework-Project-Group-10-6

Our project is based on food blog website.
We are creating food website with diffrent food categories and functions.
We are getting data from mongodb with food information.
We are creating read, insert, update, delete function from admin side to upgrade that data to table.
We are also add some new function in our project like light-dark mode, comment section, search bar, rating system and chat boat in our page.
We use Handlebars for front-end.
We also use NodeMailer and chat boat for extra.

Our project is based for user to see thee foods items as meal types and they can see food description, what is used for this food and provide them description to make the food. And user can rate the food if they like and can add a comment if they want. Chat-bot is used if they want some information.
